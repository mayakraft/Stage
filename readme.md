``` objective-c
@class Stage  (GLKViewController)
|
|---@class Curtain    // 2D layers (touch interaction enabled)
|   |
|   |--(UIView*)view  //   UIKit attach point
|
|---@class Room       // 3D layers
.
.
@class SceneController
|
@protocol SceneTransitionDelegate  // animate transitions inside Stage
|
|---@property scene  // increment or goto # to call delegate animations
```

Everything is contained inside Stage. SceneController handles transitions between scenes using Obj-C NSTimer loops and delegates, and provides start to finish tween progress (0.0 to 1.0) for animation hooks.

Curtains are see-through, they exist floating above everything else and accept touches and properly pass them to buttons and other UI elements
